# Study.com SQL Sample Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a sample SQL assignment for Study.com. The assignment uses **SQLite** instead of MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server due to its ease of setup and portability. SQLite allows you to set up the database locally without needing to rely on a server, making it convenient for testing and development.

## Contents
The SQL assignment is divided into three parts:
- **Part A**: Creates the tables, including primary and foreign keys, and sets up auto-increments.
- **Part B**: Adds data to the tables.
- **Part C**: Contains example SQL queries.

Additionally, the repository includes a `.db` file that can be used to test the queries.

## Usage
To test the queries, you can use the provided `.db` file with any SQLite-compatible tool or command-line interface.
